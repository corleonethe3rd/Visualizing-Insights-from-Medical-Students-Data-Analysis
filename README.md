# Visualizing-Insights-from-Medical-Students-Data-Analysis

## Introduction

In this documentation, we will guide you through the process of visualizing the insights obtained from the Pivot Tables created in the previous task using the 'Medical Students' data. The goal is to provide a clear and structured presentation of the health-related metrics and patterns that were discovered through data analysis.

## Project Objectives and Goals

**Visualize Health Insights:**

Present the key findings and patterns derived from the Pivot Tables, such as average health parameters, height and weight, blood group distribution, smoking habits, and diabetes prevalence among medical students.

**Facilitate Informed Decision-Making:**

Create visual representations to make the insights more accessible and actionable for healthcare strategies, wellness programs, and educational decisions.

## Project Structure and Organization

The project focuses on visualizing the insights gained from the previously generated Pivot Tables. It consists of the following core functional module:
